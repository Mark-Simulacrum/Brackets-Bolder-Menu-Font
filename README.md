Bolder Menu Font
========

Bolder menu font simply applies CSS to the elements in the menu bar to increase their font weight to 400, instead of the default 200. This improves readability.

A temporary fix for [adobe/brackets#9828](https://github.com/adobe/brackets/issues/9828).

A Pull Request for Brackets to implement this functionality into core has been filed. See <https://github.com/adobe/brackets/pull/9829>.
